Replication Guide for 3D Point Cloud Phenotyping of Chinese Cabbage
Welcome to the replication guide for our study on enhancing the phenotyping of Chinese cabbage using 3D point cloud technology. This document outlines the necessary materials, equipment, and steps to successfully replicate our experiments.

Required Materials and Equipment
RGB Camera:

A high-resolution RGB camera (e.g., FSFE-3200D-10GE from JAI) is recommended for capturing detailed images.
Rotating Platform:

A rotating platform to facilitate multi-view imaging of the cabbage samples.
Software:

Image Processing Software: Use software such as Agisoft Metashape for 3D point cloud generation.
Point Cloud Processing Tools: Utilize libraries like PCL (Point Cloud Library) and CloudCompare for processing and analyzing the point cloud data.
Chinese Cabbage Varieties:

Select a diverse range of Chinese cabbage varieties for phenotyping. Details of the specific varieties used in our study can be found in the manuscript.
Experimental Setup
Planting:

Plant the selected cabbage varieties in a randomized block design with appropriate spacing (30–40 cm) to ensure uniform growth conditions.
Image Acquisition:

Position the RGB camera on the rotating platform to capture images of each cabbage from multiple angles (60–70 images recommended).
Ensure consistent lighting conditions to minimize variability in image quality.
Data Processing Steps
3D Point Cloud Reconstruction:

Use the captured images to generate a 3D point cloud using the specified software.
Follow the procedures outlined in the code repository for data processing.
Data Analysis:

Extract relevant phenotypic parameters from the 3D point cloud data.
Conduct statistical analyses as described in our study to interpret the results.
